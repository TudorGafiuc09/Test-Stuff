            Here are some simple steps to get you started with drag. Keep in mind that the art of drag is more complex than these and you have 
            to experiment a lot before you finally achieve the desired persona.

        <br><h3>Step 1: Choose your look</h3>

        <div class="text">
            Decide whether you want to shave and which parts of your body you wish to shave (face, chest, arms, legs or full). There is 
            no right or wrong way to look when doing drag. Then, you need to choose how you're gonna shaoe your body (big queen or small queen).

        <br><h3>Step 2: Makeup and wigs</h3>

        <div class="text">
           Invest in some wild makeup and start using it. Learn the shape of your face, your eyes and your mouth. Experiment with color and 
           see what suits you best. Don't get discouraged, makeup is not easy, but with practive, you'll get better. Also, buy cheap wigs
           and try them on to see which style fits you better. Once you know which hairstyles you want, invest in more expensive wigs.

        <br><h3>Step 3: Wardrobe</h3>

        <div class="text">
            Decide which type of clothing your drga persona would wear. Along with the makeup, this is where drag starts getting expensive. 
            Start by just assembling one or two outfits. As you develop your act, you can assemble more.

        <br><h3>Step 4: Perform</h3>

        <div class="text">
            If you want, you can find local bars that host drag performances and ask to be on a show. By performing at differnet bars,
            you can get paid for the entertainment. The more popular you are, the more in-demand you are and the more you can get paid.
